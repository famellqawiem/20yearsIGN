# The Dataset: 20 Years of Games

This kernel utilizes the "20 Years of Games" dataset, which contains data on over 18,000 video game reviews from the gaming website IGN.com. The dataset includes various information such as game release dates, platforms on which games were released, critics' ratings, and more.

The kernel analyzes the dataset and presents the findings using the numpy, pandas, and matplotlib libraries. The visual representations include charts and graphs that answer the following questions:

    Which gaming platforms have received the most game reviews in the past 5 years?
    In 2016, which game genre was the most popular, and how does it compare to the most popular genre a decade earlier?
    Which year had the highest number of games listed as "Editor's Choice"?

By exploring these questions, the kernel provides insights into the trends and preferences observed in the dataset.
